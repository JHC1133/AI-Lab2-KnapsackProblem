This project focuses on solving the multiple knapsack problem, where I implemented two algorithms: a greedy algorithm and a neighborhood search algorithm. 

The greedy approach selects items based on their value-to-weight ratio, maximizing utility within the knapsacks' weight limits. 

The neighborhood search algorithm iteratively improves an initial solution by exploring neighboring solutions, swapping items between knapsacks to find better outcomes. 
Both approaches were thoroughly tested and optimized for performance.
